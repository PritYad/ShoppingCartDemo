# shopping cart demo Single-Page App

* Haven't used bootstrap. Have written all the css from scratch.
* Have used mostly native javascript for displaying and styling components and a bit of angular material too.
* To run this project :
    1) Clone it from https://github.com/PritYad/ShoppingCartDemo
    2) Run npm i(Node.js version 10.9.0 or later is required).
    3) Run ng serve from the console and open http://localhost:4200 in your browser.
    4) Have updated unit and end to end integration test cases for one file named cart.component.spec. But have tested it thoroughly.
(To run this test case add f before the first describe like (fdescribe) and then run ng test from console on this project.)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

## Running end-to-end tests
